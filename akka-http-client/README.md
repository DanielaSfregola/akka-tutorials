# Akka Http - Akka Http Client
Tutorial on how to build a http client with Akka Http.

## Requirements
First we need to run the service that our client will consume. 
You can download the code and read instructions on how to run the service here: https://github.com/DanielaSfregola/quiz-management-service/tree/master/tutorial-5

## How to run the service
Clone the repository:
```
> git clone https://github.com/DanielaSfregola/akka-tutorials.git
```

Get to the `akka-http-client` folder:
```
> cd akka-http-client
```
Run the main class to have an example of how to use the client we created:
```
> sbt run
```
